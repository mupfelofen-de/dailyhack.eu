Hello,

my name is Michael Fitzmayer and I'm a professional embedded software
engineer, hobby developer, father and husband.

I also have a strong affinity for technical matters and am passionate
about restoring historic two-stroke mopeds.

And last but not least, I have a heart for broken things that I can fix.

If you have been looking for my old personal blog, which I no longer
maintain, you can find it here:
