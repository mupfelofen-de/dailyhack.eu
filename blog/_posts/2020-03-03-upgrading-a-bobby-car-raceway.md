title: Upgrading a Bobby Car raceway

Through a series of fortunate circumstances, my friend and colleague
Samu came into possession of some traffic lights.  Which he was very
happy to prevent from being scrapped.

He used the three-coloured main lights for himself.  One as a light
organ, the other as a Jenkins status display (seriously!).  Brilliant!

So I asked him if he was willing to give me one of the smaller ones and
suddenly he agreed.  Without a second thought I build a fully working
traffic light for the Bobby Car raceway of our local day care centre.

It was a fun mini-project and of course I published the software and a
rough schematic on GitHub:
