First of all: hello and welcome to my blog
[dailyhack.eu](https://dailyhack.eu).

My name is Michael Fitzmayer, and first and foremost I'm a lucky husband
and proud father of two.  Speaking of which: our son Jakob and our
daughter KÃ¤the are truly my most important contributions to this world
and I could not imagine life without them anymore.

Besides, I'm a 33 years old, professional embedded software engineer in
the industrial and mobile automation sectors from Germany.  A career
that came about more by chance after I had been working in SMT PCB
assembly for about seven years.

This blog is the successor of my personal website
[mupfelofen.de](https://www.mupfelofen.de), which I no longer maintain.

Instead, I started this new blog to share my knowledge and enthusiasm
for technical topics such as electronics, programming and the
restoration of historic two-stroke vehicles with interested and
like-minded people.

With this in mind, I wish you a lot of fun browsing through this site.

Best regards, Michael
